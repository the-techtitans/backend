# Backend

This repo hosts the backend for the Excalibur 2023 project from team Tech Titans.

It is being written in Rust using [Axum web framework](https://lib.rs/crates/axum) and [sqlx](https://lib.rs/crates/sqlx) for interfacing with a Postgres database instance, along with other miscellaneous dependencies like Tokio.
